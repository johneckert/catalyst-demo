# catalyst-experiment

## To Be Addressed:

- there should be events raised when you mouse over an SVG component that pass it's data
- Docs pg 24: data example image headings: is an object w/o a key? - I believe it should just be the array
- for documentation v-cards & catalyst components require @click.native to add a click function
